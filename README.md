# Angular dashboard

Fully responsive Figma dashboard design implementation built with Angular & styled with SCSS.

## My Approach for Building This Project

- First, I looked up how to set up an Angular workspace to my preference.
- Visually analyzed the dashboard components.
- Generated mock data for every component which consists of similar elements with different styles or content to avoid bloating my project with redundant HTML and also to practice representing dynamic data.
- Carefully studied the constraints; in this case, the most restrictive constraint was making the comments and contacts list draggable.
- Looked up a drag & drop library in Angular and structured my HTML taking into account that it has to be compatible with the library which will be used.

## Features

- Completely responsive to all screen devices.
- Compatible with almost all browsers, I did my best to limit my usage to the most basic and most supported CSS properties.
- Implemented modern and smooth subtle animations and effects.
- Drag and drop lists.

## Directories 

- The project was build over four components located in the app directory.
- Images & Scss utility classes located in the assets directory.
